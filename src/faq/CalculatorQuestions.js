        "question": "How do auto loan interest rates work?",
        "answer": "Auto loan interest rates are determined by factors such as your credit score, the loan amount, and the term length. Lenders use these factors to assess the risk and determine the interest rate for your loan. The higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate should be. It is usually a good idea to shop around and compare rates from different lenders to find the best deal."

        "question": "How do I calculate my APR?",
        "answer": "To calculate the APR (Annual Percentage Rate), you need to consider the loan amount, interest rate, and any additional fees or charges associated with the loan. The formula for calculating APR can be a bit complex, so it’s often easier to use an online APR calculator or consult with a financial professional. They can help you determine the APR accurately based on your specific loan details."
