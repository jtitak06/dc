              The importance of privacy and security for all personally
              identifiable information associated with users is of utmost
              concern to DriveChicago.com. DriveChicago.com exercises great care
              in providing secure transmission of users' information from the
              users' personal computer to DriveChicago.com's servers.
              Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
              guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while DriveChicago.com
              strives to protect users personal information, DriveChicago.com
              cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information users
              transmit to DriveChicago.com or from DriveChicago.com's Online
              products or services, and users do so at their own risk. Once
              DriveChicago.com receives users' transmission, DriveChicago.com
              makes its best effort to ensure the transmission's security on
              DriveChicago.com's systems. If credit card information is
              transmitted, DriveChicago.com uses industry standard, SSL (secure
